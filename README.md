# Capstone Project: What A Feeling - Emotion Tracker

![Logo](public/images/logobanner.png)

What A Feeling is an emotion tracker - an app which helps people to track, analyse and understand their feelings.

The idea behind the app is based on the concept of the seven basic emotions by Paul Ekman.

It adresses people who are attending behaviour therapy but can also be generally used by everyone who wants to explore themselves.

It features a guided emotion logging, pretty data visuals, analytics as lists and charts, options for downloading and last but not least a cozy homefeeling with a theme of your choice.
