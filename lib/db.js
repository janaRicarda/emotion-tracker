      "As a social function, expressing enjoyment plays an important role in signaling friendliness and assuring that we are not a threat to others. Many emotions scientists agree that enjoyable emotions motivate us to do things that are, by and large, good for us and the survival of our species (i.e., reproducing and child-rearing). Many emotions scientists also agree that the pursuit of enjoyment is a primary motivation in our lives.",

    description:
      "Fear is one of the seven universal emotions experienced by everyone around the world. Fear arises with the threat of harm, either physical, emotional, or psychological, real or imagined. While traditionally considered a “negative” emotion, fear actually serves an important role in keeping us safe as it mobilizes us to cope with potential danger. The family of fearful experiences can be distinguished in terms of three factors: Intensity: How severe is the harm that is threatened? Timing: Is the harm immediate or impending? Coping: What, if any, actions can be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat? When we are able to cope with the threat, this lessens or removes the fear. Alternatively, when we are helpless to decrease the threat of harm, this intensifies the fear.",
    emotionfunction:
      "The universal function of fear is to avoid or reduce harm. Depending on what we have learned in the past about what can protect us in dangerous situations, we are capable of doing many things we wouldn’t typically be able, or willing, to do in order to stop the threat. The immediate threat of harm focuses our attention, mobilizing us to cope with the danger. In this way, fear can actually save our lives by forcing us to react without having to think about it (e.g., jumping out of the way of a car coming at us). The evolutionary preset actions of fear include fight, flight and freezing. While traditionally considered a “negative” emotion, fear actually serves an important role in keeping us safe. It can, however, also keep us feeling trapped and prevent us from doing things we’d like to. Whereas some people find fear nearly intolerable and avoid the emotion at all costs, others experience pleasure from feeling fear and seek it out (i.e., watching a horror film). It takes a well-developed capacity for compassion to respect, feel sympathetic toward, and patiently reassure someone who is afraid of something we are not afraid of (most of us dismiss such fears). We do not need to feel another person's fear to accept it and help them cope.",
    indications:
      "Common sensations include feeling cold and shortness of breath. It also may include sweating and trembling or tightening of muscles in the arms and legs. The posture of fear can either be one of mobilizing or immobilizing- freezing or moving away.",

Dr. Ekman’s original list of universal emotions, discovered during his groundbreaking research in New Guinea in the 1960s, didn’t include contempt but he later added it after his continued cross-cultural research.",
    emotionfunction:
      "It’s widely believed that the function of contempt is to signal a feeling of superiority, of not needing to accomodate or engage, and to assert power or status.",
    indications:
      "Considering people have a variety of reactions to feeling contempt, the sensations associated with the feeling can be quite different depending on the situation. At times, it may be felt with sensations similar to anger (i.e., tension, heat, etc.) and other times may be felt with enjoyment (i.e., elevated, uplifted, etc.). It can also feel uncomfortable and/or embarrassing to feel. It’s common to “puff up” one’s chest, have upright posture, look “down your nose” at others, and/or roll one’s eyes.",

      "The universal function of disgust is to get away from, block off, or eliminate something offensive, toxic or contaminating.",
    indications:
      "Common sensations include revulsion in the mouth, throat, and/or stomach, and nausea, or physical repulsion (i.e., vomiting).

    emotionfunction:
      "Anger easily causes harm to ourselves and others. Psychologists are unclear about whether the wish to harm is built into the core of anger or if it is something we learn, but we know it often is a part of the anger process that gets us into trouble. In both psychological and contemplative traditions, it is acknowledged that anger can be useful when it’s motivated by compassion and expressed with discernment. However, because anger can easily initiate a cycle of violence, one has to be very honest and clear in one’s assessment to determine whether or not it’s constructive anger.",
